# Movies Catalog


**_This project is a work in progress_**


I aim to create an application that uses some tables that combines information to form a greater piece - a movie.
A movie (inspired by IMDB) has many different pieces of information that are split into table relationships - **1..N relationship**, **N..N relationship**, and so on.


With this project, I intend to practice not only table relationships but continue improving on **HTTP API** and creating an **endpoint** to list movies that support pagination.


As my focus is on the **back-end**, I asked ChatGPT  to generate some simple HTML pages for me to display some data.
